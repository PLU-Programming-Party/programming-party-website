            G'day mate! Welcome to the Programming Party - where the code flows like a cold one on a hot arvo! 🦘
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
        Programming Party started in 2019 as a way for PLU students to collaborate on creative software projects. 
        What began as a small group has grown into a vibrant community of builders, thinkers, and creatives.
    </p>

        <strong>🪃 Fair dinkum!</strong> Just like a good barbie brings everyone together, Programming Party creates that same community vibe - except instead of snags, we're serving up hot code and fresh ideas!
    </p>
    
    <h2>What We Build</h2>
    <p>
        Our projects range from serious applications to delightfully silly experiments. We believe that the best learning 
        happens when you're having fun, so we embrace unconventional ideas and playful execution.
    </p>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.8;">
            <em>(To the tune of "Waltzing Matilda")</em><br><br>
            Once a jolly coder sat beside their terminal,<br>
            Under the shade of a syntax tree,<br>
            And they sang as they watched and waited for their build to compile,<br>
            "You'll come a-Programming Party with me!"<br><br>
            <strong>Chorus:</strong><br>
            Programming Party, Programming Party,<br>
            You'll come a-Programming Party with me!<br>
            And we'll code as we watch and wait for our tests to pass,<br>
            You'll come a-Programming Party with me!
