    <h1>About Programming Party</h1>
    
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
        Programming Party started in 2019 as a way for PLU students to collaborate on creative software projects. 
        What began as a small group has grown into a vibrant community of builders, thinkers, and creatives.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What We Build</h2>
    <p>
        Our projects range from serious applications to delightfully silly experiments. We believe that the best learning 
        happens when you're having fun, so we embrace unconventional ideas and playful execution.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Community Values</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Creativity First</strong>: We value creative thinking over production-grade code</li>
        <li><strong>Learning Over Winning</strong>: Failed experiments teach as much as successful projects</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: We build together, not alone</li>
        <li><strong>Fun</strong>: If it's not fun, why are we doing it?</li>
        <li><strong>Openness</strong>: All skill levels welcome</li>
    </ul>
